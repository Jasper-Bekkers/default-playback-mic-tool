# Default playback & Mic resetting tool

GPU drivers tend to install new audio drivers along side them and reset my audio setup, so I've hardcoded it into this tool so it can reset my setup after a driver update. Feel free to fork the tool and have it reset your audio setup as well.

Basically a hacked up version of http://www.daveamenta.com/2011-05/programmatically-or-command-line-change-the-default-sound-playback-device-in-windows-7/
